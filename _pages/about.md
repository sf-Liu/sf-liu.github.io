## Hi, I’m glad you’re here.
I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), with a research focus on computer vision and edge computing. My work spans depth estimation, streaming 3D reconstruction, vision–language models (VLMs), speculative decoding for large language models, and efficient model deployment on Qualcomm and NVIDIA platforms.

My research aims to extend advanced computer vision capabilities to AR/VR and XR devices. I am a first-author on multiple publications, including work submitted to ***CVPR***, where I applied quantization and hardware-aware optimization techniques to achieve real-time depth estimation on mobile devices. Through these projects, I have developed strong expertise in software–hardware co-design.

My recent work focuses on 3D reconstruction for XR scenarios, particularly addressing out-of-memory challenges in long-context video processing through a graph-based memory bank design. In parallel, I am working on air quality estimation using hyperspectral imagery, leveraging vision–language models (VLM) for multi-modal environmental sensing.

Previously, I interned at **[NIO](https://www.nio.com/)** (an electric vehicle manufacturer) in San Jose, where I worked on speculative decoding for large language models and deployed them on automotive-grade computing platforms

***I am currently seeking internship opportunities for Spring and Summer 2026.***
